# Mixtapes & Memory: Social Equity & Reparations License

Version 1.0

### 1. Overview
This license governs the use, remixing, and distribution of the "Mixtapes & Memory" application code. This project documents Black history and labor; this license ensures that any further adaptation contributes to the continued flourishing of Black creators.

### 2. The Reparations Clause
If you identify as white (or as a person of proximity to systemic whiteness) and you choose to remix, adapt, or redistribute this code, you are required to make a one-time donation of at least $40 (USD) to an organization that specifically supports Black women in technology, media, or the arts.

### 3. Suggested Organizations
Acceptable organizations include, but are not limited to:
* **Black Girls CODE**
* **Black Women Talk Tech**
* **The Loveland Foundation**
* **Local Black-led arts councils or mutual aid funds.**

### 4. Proof of Action
While this license operates on a "honor system" of integrity, users are encouraged to include a note in their redistributed repository or "About" section stating: *"Remixed under the Mixtapes & Memory Reparations License. Contribution made to [Organization Name]."*

### 5. Attribution & ShareAlike
* **Attribution:** You must credit the original project and the Shirley Ann Griffin-Martin Archive.
* **Non-Commercial:** This code may not be used for commercial profit without express written consent.
* **ShareAlike:** Any adaptations must be released under this same Reparations License.
